# Architecture

## Layer 1: OpenCode native

OpenCode provides the base session model, child sessions, agents, tools, and MCP runtime.

## Layer 2: OMO Slim

OMO Slim provides specialist agents, model routing, lane specialization, and prompt-bridge behavior.

## Layer 3: Superpowers

Superpowers provides the workflow/controller layer:

- brainstorming
- planning
- implementation discipline
- review loops
- verification
- completion flow

## Cooperation model

- Superpowers remains the director
- OMO Slim provides the worker seats
- the plugin snippet intentionally disables OpenCode's default `general` and `explore` lanes to avoid duplicate/default lane competition
- only Superpowers skills are selectively restricted
- only OMO-managed MCPs are selectively restricted
- all other custom skills and MCPs remain available

Within the council/councillor area, `councillor` is an internal-only worker used by the council flow rather than a normal user-facing agent lane. It intentionally keeps OMO Slim's internal/upstream council prompt behavior, so this patch kit does not publish a separate `councillor` prompt bridge file.

Patches mainly constrain Layer 2 worker behavior, prompt bridges connect Layer 2 seats to Layer 3 workflow rules, and config templates pin the Layer 1+2 wiring that makes the stack reproducible.

## Permission Model

The patch-kit governs per-agent permissions across three resource classes via a 3-layer overlay. See the full design spec at `docs/specs/2026-05-05-permission-redesign.md`.

Key invariants:

- Tier-3 read-only agents deny `edit`, `write`, `bash`, and `todowrite`; most also deny `task`, with `council` as the explicit exception because it dispatches `councillor`.
- Restricted MCPs (`windows-mcp`, `chrome-devtools`, `playwright`) are denied for non-operator agents via `src/config/agent-mcp-blacklist.ts`.
- Reserved skills (`best-of-n-with-judge`, `update-memory`) are allowed only for `orchestrator` / `orchestrator-beta` via `src/config/orchestrator-only-skills.ts`.
- Other third-party MCPs are untouched and implicit-allow unless later added to the blacklist.

## Optional: Best-of-N support (patch 0003 + `opencode-config/`)

The kit's optional best-of-N extension introduces 20 additional sub-agents on top of the base 9 (orchestrator + 8 specialists):

- **16 variant agents**: 4 each of `fixer`, `oracle`, `designer` + 2 each of `explorer`, `librarian`. Each variant runs the same base prompt as its parent agent but with a different model and reasoning effort. They exist for parallel candidate generation in best-of-N fan-out.

- **4 utility agents**: `scout` (narrow file lookup), `validator` (format check), `gist` (3-line summarizer), `wildcard` (divergent ideation noise). These are NOT in the best-of-N pool — they are independent latency-optimized roles for narrow tasks and brainstorming Phase 4 ideation injection.

### Registration mechanism

All 20 are registered as **OMO Slim custom agents** via `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` `presets.superpowers-bridge.<name>` entries (same code path as the user-defined `laborer` agent — `getCustomAgentNames()` discovers unknown keys and `buildCustomAgentDefinition()` registers them). No opencode-native `agent` block entries are needed (and adding them would shallow-replace OMO's synthesized permissions).

### Suffix-stripping policy resolution

Patch 0003 modifies `src/cli/superpowers-policy.ts` and `src/cli/skills.ts` to add `resolveBaseAgentName()`:

```
"fixer-alpha" -> "fixer"   (suffix stripped, inherits fixer policy)
"oracle-gamma" -> "oracle"  (suffix stripped, inherits oracle policy)
"validator"   -> "validator" (already in map, explicit policy)
"scout"       -> "scout"     (already in map, empty allowed)
```

Without this patch, suffixed names would not be in the `AGENT_ALLOWED_SUPERPOWERS` map and would silently lose access to their base agent's superpowers (e.g., `fixer-alpha` would lose `test-driven-development`). The patch keeps inheritance automatic — adding a new variant requires zero code changes.

### Behavioral contract layering

For each best-of-N agent:

| Field | Source | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `model`, `variant`, `mcps`, `orchestratorPrompt` | `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` | OMO Slim manages these; preset switching applies |
| `permission`, `hidden`, `mode`, `temperature`, `description`, `prompt` (file ref) | markdown in `~/.config/opencode/agents/<name>.md` | OpenCode-native fields OMO Slim does not manage |
| Superpowers skill policy | `src/cli/superpowers-policy.ts` (auto via suffix resolution) | inheritance from base |
| Non-OMO MCP permissions | preserved by default | OMO only synthesizes managed MCP rules |
| Non-superpowers skills | preserved by default (`*: allow` overlay) | only superpowers names get explicit deny |

### Best-of-n-with-judge skill

A separate user-level skill (in `opencode-config/skills/best-of-n-with-judge/`) orchestrates fan-out: pre-flight verification, git worktree setup, parallel candidate dispatch, hard-gate filter, blind oracle review, vote aggregation, council arbitration on splits, redo loop on no-winner, winner landing via cherry-pick or squash, and unconditional cleanup. See the skill's `SKILL.md` for full pipeline details.

## Orchestrator prefix matching (patch 0004, v1.2.0)

OMO Slim originally hardcoded the literal string `'orchestrator'` in four runtime sites:

1. `src/cli/superpowers-policy.ts` `getAllowedSuperpowersSkillsForAgent` — orchestrator gets the full superpowers allowlist
2. `src/agents/index.ts` `applyClassification` — orchestrator alone gets `mode = 'primary'`
3. `src/index.ts` post-file-tool nudge hook — fires only for the literal orchestrator session
4. `src/index.ts` chat.system.transform hook — injects the orchestrator bridge prompt only for the literal orchestrator session

Patch 0004 introduces a small helper `isOrchestratorAgent(name)` that returns `true` for any name starting with `orchestrator` (literal, dash-suffix variants like `orchestrator-beta`, no-separator variants like `orchestrator2`, etc.) and replaces all four equality checks with the helper.

### Why a fallback orchestrator matters

Anthropic API has 5-hour rolling rate limits per model. When a primary orchestrator running on (e.g.) `claude-opus-4-7` exhausts its quota, the entire session stalls until the cooldown clears. With patch 0004, you can register a second orchestrator (e.g. `orchestrator-beta` running on a vendor-diverse model like `gpt-5.4 + xhigh`) as a peer primary agent. Switching to it from the OpenCode agent picker resumes work immediately — the bridge prompt, MCPs, permissions, and superpowers allowlist all auto-inherit from the literal orchestrator.

### Behavioral inheritance for `orchestrator-*` variants

| Field | Source | How it flows to `orchestrator-beta` |
|---|---|---|
| Bridge prompt | Resolved at runtime from the literal orchestrator definition (`agentDefs.find(a => a.name === 'orchestrator')`) | Hook unchanged; `isOrchestratorAgent()` gate widened |
| `mode = 'primary'` | `applyClassification` switch in `src/agents/index.ts` | Generalized via `isOrchestratorAgent()` |
| Superpowers allowlist | `getAllowedSuperpowersSkillsForAgent` policy | Generalized via `isOrchestratorAgent()` |
| `permission` (`question: allow`, `council_session: deny`, `skill: { ... }`) | `applyDefaultPermissions` runs on every custom agent (existing path) | No change; auto-inherited |
| `mcps` | OMO Slim resolves from the agent's preset entry; copying `["*", "!context7"]` from `orchestrator` to `orchestrator-beta` mirrors behavior | User-supplied in `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` |
| `model`, `variant` | User-supplied in `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc` | The whole point — this is what you change |

Adding a new orchestrator-shaped agent is therefore purely a configuration change: a single jsonc entry with `model` + `mcps`, and (optionally) an `agents/<name>.md` markdown for OpenCode-native fields like `description` or `displayName`.

## Anthropic-aware cooldown tracking (patch 0005, v1.3.0)

OMO Slim's `ForegroundFallbackManager` already implements per-session model fallback (when a model rate-limits, abort the prompt and replay the last user message on the next model in the chain). Patch 0005 extends this to also handle **cross-session** Anthropic 5-hour rolling rate limits.

### The problem patch 0005 solves

Anthropic API enforces 5-hour rolling token/request quotas. When exhausted, the API returns a 429 with response headers:

```
anthropic-ratelimit-requests-reset:       2026-05-05T17:00:00Z
anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-reset:         2026-05-05T17:00:00Z
anthropic-ratelimit-input-tokens-reset:   2026-05-05T17:00:00Z
anthropic-ratelimit-output-tokens-reset:  2026-05-05T17:00:00Z
```

Without patch 0005, OMO Slim's foreground fallback successfully recovers within a single session (one wasted ~30s OpenCode-native retry storm, then sticks to the fallback model). But every NEW session that starts during the cooldown window repeats the wasted retry: try Opus → 429 → wait 2s → 429 → wait 4s → ... → 429 → fire error event → switch to fallback. That's 30 seconds of latency on the first message of every fresh session, for the next 5 hours.

### The fix

Patch 0005 introduces three integrations:

1. **Header parsing** (`src/hooks/foreground-fallback/cooldowns.ts:parseAnthropicCooldown`)
   - Inspects all four `anthropic-ratelimit-*-reset` headers (case-insensitive)
   - Returns the latest reset epoch, or `null` if no recognizable header
   - Robust to malformed values (skips them silently)

2. **Persistent disk-backed store** (`src/hooks/foreground-fallback/cooldowns.ts:createCooldownStore`)
   - File: `<getConfigDir()>/.omo-slim-cooldowns.json` (hidden filename)
   - Atomic temp+rename writes (mirrors `src/cli/config-io.ts:172-194`)
   - Auto-purges expired entries on construction
   - `set()` persists immediately (crash-safe)
   - Optional `nowFn` injection for deterministic tests

3. **Two integration sites in the manager + plugin init**
   - `ForegroundFallbackManager.captureCooldown()` extracts headers and updates the store on every detected rate-limit event
   - `ForegroundFallbackManager.tryFallback()` chain selection prefers `!tried && !cooling`, falling back to `!tried` (cooldown is a soft hint)
   - `src/index.ts` startup-time `effectiveArrays` loop reads from `foregroundFallback.getCooldownStore()` to skip cooled models when picking the FIRST model for each agent — this is what eliminates the cross-session retry storm

### Behavior matrix

| Scenario | Before patch 0005 | After patch 0005 |
|---|---|---|
| First message of session, primary not rate-limited | Hits primary directly | Hits primary directly |
| First message of session, primary just rate-limited | ~30s wait (4 native retries) → fallback | ~30s wait → fallback + cooldown recorded |
| Subsequent messages in same session | Already on fallback (no wait) | Already on fallback (no wait) |
| New session within 5h cooldown window | ~30s wait (4 native retries) → fallback | **Starts on fallback directly (zero wait)** |
| Fresh OpenCode start within 5h cooldown window | ~30s wait → fallback | **Starts on fallback directly (zero wait)** |
| New session AFTER cooldown reset elapsed | Starts on primary (working) | Starts on primary (working) — store auto-purges expired entries |

### Provider-id-agnostic design

The cooldown machinery uses only the agent's configured `provider/model` string as the key. Future Anthropic models (claude-opus-5, claude-sonnet-5, etc.) automatically benefit without code changes. To extend support to a new provider that emits its own reset header (e.g. OpenAI's `x-ratelimit-reset-tokens`), only `parseAnthropicCooldown` needs a new case — the store and manager are already provider-agnostic.

### Future model swaps (maintenance)

Future model updates are pure jsonc edits in `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc`. The patch never needs regeneration when models change — it has zero hardcoded model IDs.
