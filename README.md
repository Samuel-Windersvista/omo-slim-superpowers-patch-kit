# OMO Slim + Superpowers Patch Kit

A third-party patch kit for patching a local editable `oh-my-opencode-slim` checkout so it cooperates cleanly with `superpowers` in OpenCode.

Upstream/source snapshot notice: see [`UPSTREAM.md`](./UPSTREAM.md).
An included copy of the upstream MIT license is provided at [`UPSTREAM-LICENSE-oh-my-opencode-slim.txt`](./UPSTREAM-LICENSE-oh-my-opencode-slim.txt).

## Quick start

Tell OpenCode: Fetch and follow instructions from https://github.com/BB-84C/omo-slim-superpowers-patch-kit/blob/main/docs/install.md

## What this repo does

This kit is for users who want:

- `superpowers` to remain the workflow/controller layer
- `oh-my-opencode-slim` to provide specialist agents and per-agent model routing
- only `superpowers` skills to be selectively restricted
- only OMO-managed MCPs to be selectively restricted
- all other custom skills and MCPs left untouched

## Tested versions

Validated with:

- `superpowers v5.0.7`
- `oh-my-opencode-slim v1.0.1`

Nearby newer versions will likely still work, but if patch application fails or behavior differs, inspect the provided snapshots before proceeding.

## What this kit patches

This patch kit changes OMO Slim in six ways:

1. **Superpowers-only skill gating** (patch 0001)
   - OMO Slim only selectively restricts `superpowers` skills
   - your other custom skills remain available unless you restrict them yourself

2. **OMO-managed MCP-only gating** (patch 0002)
   - OMO Slim only selectively restricts its own built-in MCPs:
     - `websearch`
     - `context7`
     - `grep_app`
   - your other MCPs remain untouched

3. **Best-of-N agent name resolution** (patch 0003)
   - Variant agents like `fixer-alpha`, `oracle-gamma` are auto-resolved to their base via suffix-stripping (`resolveBaseAgentName`)
   - Variants inherit the base agent's superpowers permission policy without needing per-variant entries
   - Adds explicit policy entries for fast-lane utility agents (`scout`, `validator`, `gist`, `wildcard`)
   - Required if you adopt the optional `opencode-config/` example setup (best-of-N + fast-lane agents)

4. **Orchestrator prefix matching** (patch 0004, v1.2.0)
   - Generalizes the four hardcoded `agentName === 'orchestrator'` checks in OMO Slim to a `isOrchestratorAgent()` helper that matches any name starting with `orchestrator` (e.g. `orchestrator`, `orchestrator-beta`, `orchestrator2`)
   - Lets you define fallback primary orchestrators (different model, same behavior) so the OpenCode agent picker shows multiple switchable orchestrators
   - Common use case: avoid 5-hour rate-limit downtime by switching to `orchestrator-beta` (running on a vendor-diverse model) when your main orchestrator's quota is exhausted
   - Recommended for all installations; skip only if you intentionally need orchestrator-shaped names to NOT be treated as orchestrators

5. **Anthropic-aware cooldown tracking** (patch 0005, v1.3.0)
   - Parses Anthropic's `anthropic-ratelimit-*-reset` response headers when a rate-limit error fires
   - Persists per-model cooldown state to disk at `~/.config/opencode/.omo-slim-cooldowns.json`
   - Skips cooled-down models in BOTH the runtime fallback chain (mid-session) AND the startup-time model selection (fresh sessions)
   - Eliminates the ~30s of OpenCode-native exponential-backoff retries that would otherwise burn against a known-rate-limited model on the first message of each new session
   - Pairs with patch 0003's model-array fallback (`agents.<name>.model: [primary, backup]`) to make Anthropic 5-hour rolling quotas effectively transparent to the user
   - The cooldown store is provider/model-id-agnostic — future Anthropic models automatically get the same header parsing without code changes

6. **Agent permission redesign** (patch 0006, v1.4.0)
   - Tier-3 read-only agents (`oracle*`, `explorer*`, `librarian*`, `observer`, `council`, `councillor`, `scout`, `validator`, `gist`, `wildcard`) now deny `edit`, `write`, `bash`, `task`, `todowrite`. `council` is the explicit exception that keeps `task` for dispatching `councillor`.
   - Closed-set restricted MCP blacklist (`windows-mcp`, `chrome-devtools`, `playwright`) auto-denied for non-operator agents via `src/config/agent-mcp-blacklist.ts`. Future restricted MCPs require only one new line.
   - Reserved orchestrator-only skills (`best-of-n-with-judge`, `update-memory`) are exclusive to `orchestrator` and `orchestrator-beta`.
   - Oracle Superpowers allowlist tightened to `systematic-debugging` only. `receiving-code-review` moved to `fixer` and `designer` (the receivers of code review). `simplify` custom skill moved from `oracle` to `fixer`.
   - Includes a fix for a pre-existing shallow-merge bug in `src/index.ts` that dropped `permission.skill` for agents with user markdown — see `### Fixed` in CHANGELOG.

It also includes prompt bridge files so OMO Slim agents understand how to behave inside a Superpowers-managed workflow.

This kit patches source, then expects you to build that local checkout before pointing OpenCode at it.

The provided OpenCode plugin snippet intentionally disables the default `general` and `explore` lanes so they do not compete with the patched OMO Slim worker layout.

## Optional: Best-of-N + Fast-Lane example setup

The kit ships an optional `opencode-config/` subtree that demonstrates the maintainer's complete best-of-N setup on top of the patched OMO Slim base:

- 16 best-of-N variant agents (4 each of fixer/oracle/designer + 2 each of explorer/librarian) for parallel candidate generation with blind oracle review
- 4 fast-lane utility agents (`scout`, `validator`, `gist`, `wildcard`) for latency-critical narrow tasks and divergent ideation
- A `best-of-n-with-judge` skill orchestrating fan-out, hard-gate filtering, voting, redo loops, and winner landing
- Shared base prompts and design docs

This is opt-in. The base patch kit (patches 0001 + 0002 + bridges + base agent template) works without it.

## What this kit does NOT do

- It does not replace Superpowers with OMO Slim
- It does not turn OMO Slim into the workflow controller
- It does not replace OpenCode itself
- It does not manage your auth, secrets, or session data
- It does not overwrite your existing MCP block unless you choose to do that manually

## Repository layout

- `patches/` — patch files to apply against an upstream local OMO Slim checkout (6 patches: skill gating, MCP gating, best-of-N name resolution, orchestrator prefix matching, Anthropic cooldown tracking, agent permission redesign)
- `snapshots/` — validated modified source files for manual comparison
- `config-templates/` — template configs based on the maintainer profile
- `prompt-bridges/` — per-agent append prompts for Superpowers-aware behavior
- `opencode-config/` — optional example mirror of the maintainer's `~/.config/opencode/` artifacts demonstrating the best-of-N + fast-lane setup (`agents/`, `prompts/`, `skills/best-of-n-with-judge/`, `docs/plans/`)
- `docs/` — install, verify, rollback, and architecture notes

## Maintainer profile included

This repo includes a validated opinionated default profile based on the maintainer's setup.

You do not have to use the exact same models or agent mappings, but the templates are designed to provide a working starting point.

## Verification checklist

After installation, verify:

- Superpowers bootstrap is active
- `orchestrator`, `fixer`, `oracle`, `explorer`, `librarian`, `designer`, `observer`, and `council` are available
- `councillor` is treated as an internal-only council worker, not a normal end-user lane
- `councillor` intentionally uses OMO Slim's internal/upstream council prompt flow and does not require a separate published prompt bridge file
- `fixer` and `oracle` cannot access blocked Superpowers skills
- `fixer` and `oracle` can still access your custom MCPs
- OMO built-in MCP restrictions do not affect your own MCPs

If you installed the optional `opencode-config/` setup, also verify:
- 16 variant agents (`fixer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`, `oracle-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`, `designer-{alpha,beta,gamma,delta}`, `explorer-{alpha,beta}`, `librarian-{alpha,beta}`) are dispatchable via the task tool
- 4 utility agents (`scout`, `validator`, `gist`, `wildcard`) are dispatchable
- Variant agents inherit base superpowers (e.g., `@fixer-alpha` can use `verification-before-completion`)
- The `best-of-n-with-judge` skill is loadable

If you applied patch 0004 and added an `orchestrator-beta` (or other orchestrator-prefix variant) entry to your OMO Slim config, also verify:
- The variant orchestrator is visible in the OpenCode agent picker as a primary mode
- Switching to it preserves all bridge prompts, MCPs, and superpowers skill access (only the underlying model changes)

If you applied patch 0005 and configured a model fallback array on any agent (e.g. `"orchestrator": { "model": [opus, gpt-5.4] }`), also verify:
- The cooldown file is created at `~/.config/opencode/.omo-slim-cooldowns.json` after the first observed rate-limit event
- After a rate-limit event mid-session, subsequent prompts in the SAME session use the fallback model directly with no wait
- After restarting OpenCode while a cooldown is still active, the next session starts on the fallback model directly (no 30-second retry storm against the rate-limited primary)
- After the recorded reset time elapses, future sessions resume on the primary model normally

If you applied patch 0006, also verify:
- Tier-3 read-only agents deny `edit`, `write`, `bash`, `task`, and `todowrite` (`council` keeps `task` for `councillor` dispatch)
- Non-operator agents deny restricted MCPs (`windows-mcp`, `chrome-devtools`, `playwright`)
- Reserved orchestrator-only skills (`best-of-n-with-judge`, `update-memory`) remain exclusive to `orchestrator` and `orchestrator-beta`
- Agents with user markdown and their own `permission:` block retain plugin-emitted `permission.skill` entries

## Rollback

If you want to undo this integration:

1. remove the patched OMO Slim plugin entry from `opencode.json`
2. restore your previous `oh-my-opencode-slim.jsonc`
3. remove the prompt bridge files
4. optionally delete the local patched OMO Slim checkout

See `docs/rollback.md` for the detailed checklist.
